# CS313E Term Project

For my project I used Anvil. Anvil is a platform for building full-stack web apps with nothing but Python.  The app in this repository is built with [Anvil](https://anvil.works?utm_source=github:app_README), the framework for building web apps with nothing but Python. You can clone this app into your own Anvil account to use and modify.

## Viewing the Python Code in the Anvil Editor

Click this [link to clone the app and look at the python code in Anvil](https://anvil.works/build#clone:N34QEHEET3GBONMV=75AD7R4JQEVMOM5TSU2PWWO2) to access the fully run website with all the python running in the background.

Finally, click "Clone App".

This app will then be in your Anvil account, ready for you to run it and view the python code for P5_Marbles, Server Module, and the Timer function!

### Running the app yourself:

Find the **Run** button at the top-right of the Anvil editor:

## Viewing the Python code on GitHub
Click on this [anvil website](https://whispered-overjoyed-menu.anvil.app) to view the functioning website for testing. If you want to view python code in GitHub, click on the client_code and server_code folder and for those with another folder inside it, click on the \_\_init\_\_.py files to view the python code, otherwise click on the files for the python codes.
